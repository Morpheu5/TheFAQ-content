# Can the UK control its own borders?

Yes. The British government retains full control over its own border controls. Travellers who hold EU passports canâ€™t cross the UK border without having their passport or identity checked, and the same applies for travellers from non-EU countries.

The UK can, and does, perform passport and identity checks at its borders and refuses entry to travellers who do not travel with valid identity documents [even if they are from another EU member state](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eea-nationals-eun01/eea-nationals-eun01).
