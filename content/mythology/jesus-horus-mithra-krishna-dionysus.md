# Was Jesus Horus / Mithra / Krishna / Dionysus?

No, he was not. While Jesus has some characteristics in common with other religions deities, he is very different from all of them (and they are pretty different one another). The theory about Jesus being a slightly adapted version of some previous myth was widespread by the conspiracy movie _Zeitgeist_.

## Horus

The alleged common characteristics between Jesus and Horus are:

* They were both born to a virgin mother. False: in the main myths, Horus was born via sexual intercourse between Osiris and Isis, while Osiris was being recomposed and brought back to life after being dismembered. The myth is founded on Osiris being still somewhat able to impregnate Isis. [HorusAncient]
* They were both baptized: Horus was baptized by Anup the Baptizer, who was later beheaded. False: there is no Anup the Baptizer in the Egyptian mythology.
* They were both announced by a comet. False: there is no reference to a comet in any Horus myth.
* They both walked on water. False: there is no reference to the ability of walking on water in any Horus myth. This is however an easily allegeable characteristic for any deity.
* They both healed the sick. True: there are some references to the ability of Horus in healing scorpion and snake bites. Another easily allegeable characteristic, and the more widespread myths give this ability especially to his mother Isis [EyeOfRa]
* They both healed the blind. False. There is no reference to blind people healed in any Horus myth.
* They both were crucified and he rose from the dead after three days. False: Horus was bitten by a scorpion and was brought back to life by Thoth. There is no actual evidence that Egyptians used to crucify people, and no reference to the three days.
* They both had twelve followers. False: there are plenty of references to Horus having followers, obviously, but they rarely are twelve and the number is not meaningful at all.

## Mithra

It is important to consider that:

* There are two version of Mithra, the original Persian one and the Roman one.
* Mithraism survived the rise of the Christianity, and evolved long after it. Some studies [Nash1999] suggest that some of the Mithraic myth was inspired by the Christian one.

The alleged common characteristics between Jesus and Mithra are:

* They were both born to a virgin mother. False: Mithra was born as a young boy from a rock, in all versions of the myth. [MithraBritannica]
* They were both born on December 25. False: neither Mithra nor Jesus were born on December 25. December 25 is the traditional day to celebrate the birth of Jesus in the Christian churches, and it was probably chosen to eradicate the celebration of Sol Invictus. Mithra is _not_ Sol Invictus, the celebration of Sol Invictus didn't celebrate his birth day, and there is no reference to December 25 in the myth of Mithra.
* They were both announced by a comet. False: there is no reference to a comet in any Mithraic myth.
* They both had twelve followers. False: in the Persian myth, Mithra had one companion. In the Roman myth, he had two companions: Cautes and Cautopates [MithraTertullian]
* They both performed miracles. True. Duh.
* They were both dead for three days and rose back. False: there is absolutely no reference to Mithra's death in the Mithraic mythology.

## Krishna

The alleged common characteristics between Jesus and Krishna are:

* They were both born to a virgin mother. False: Krishna was the eight son of his mother. [KrishnaLearnReligions]
* They were both announced by a comet. False: there is no reference to a comet in the mythology of Krishna.
* They both performed miracles. True. You don't say.
* They were both called "Son of God". False: while Krishna was indeed the son of a god, this characteristic is not mentioned in the usual epithets Krishna.
* They were both the son of a carpenter. False: Krishna was born in a pretty rich family.
* They both rose from the dead. False: Krishna died and his soul ascended detached from the body. [HowDidKrishnaDie]
  
## Dionysus

The alleged common characteristics between Jesus and Dionysus are:

* They both were born to a virgin mother. False: there are multiple versions [BritannicaDionysus] of the Dionysus birth, but none of them imply a virgin mother.
* They both were travelers and teacher. True.
* They both transformed water into wine. False: there are no reference to this miracle in the myth of Dionysus.
* They both were called "holy baby". False: Dionysus was not worshipped as a baby.
