# Bullshit Asymmetry Principle

> The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

Publicly formulated the first time in January 2013 [Twitter2013] by Alberto Brandolini. A similar concept, the Mountain of Shit Theory, was formulated by blogger Uriel Fanelli in 2010, roughly stating the same sentence [Uriel2010].

For a historical perspective, please see [Hercule's fifth labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules#Fifth:_Augean_stables).
