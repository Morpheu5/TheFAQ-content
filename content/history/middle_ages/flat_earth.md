# In the European Middle Ages the Earth was believed flat

The Earth wasn't believed flat in the European Middle Ages: the Earth was proved spherical in the classic era.

The mainstream medieval philosophical currents was strictly bonded to the late classic philosophy, which believed the Earth spherical.

The early Christian philosophers believed the Earth to be spherical [DeGenesi], and the idea of a flat Earth was discredited, and it was almost completely eradicated in the IX century, with the knowledge of the Arab astronomy. Thomas Aquinas assumed that his readers knew that a spherical Earth is mathematically and physically demonstrable [SummaTheologica].

The medieval emperors widely used the _Globus Cruciger_ [GlobusCruciger], an orb representing the Earth surmounted by a cross, as a symbol of their power over the globe.
